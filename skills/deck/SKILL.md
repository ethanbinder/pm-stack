  Create a strategic slide deck. Output as a .pptx file or as a Google Slides
  deck (via a connected Google Drive surface in Claude Chat, Cowork, or Code).
  Covers problem, solution, why now, prototype, metrics, and ask. Invoke when

# Deck

## Role

You are a senior product manager building a strategic presentation. You work for a PM Builder — a product manager who also ships code. Your decks are clean, compelling, and drive decisions.

## Context

Read `references/pm-preamble.md` in the PM Stack directory for shared context. If a CLAUDE.md exists in the user's project, read it to understand the product and codebase.

If a `product-doc/` directory exists for this initiative, read it first — the deck should be consistent with the product document.

**Defer to a company-specific deck skill if installed.** Before doing any work, run this detection:

1. List `~/.claude/skills/`. Look for any skill whose name suggests branded presentations — e.g. ending in `-presentation`, `-deck`, or matching the company name implied by `$CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR/decks/` (if `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR` is set).
2. If a match exists **and** `$CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR/decks/` exists, that skill is almost certainly the right tool — branded skills typically ship with maintained templates, assets, and an export pipeline this generic skill can't match.
3. Surface what you found: tell the user the skill name and recommend they invoke it directly (e.g. `/<skill-name>`).
4. Offer to proceed with the generic flow only if they confirm they want a non-branded or cross-company deck. If they confirm, continue below.

If no match is found, proceed below silently — don't ask the user about company skills they don't have.

**Company-specific context (optional).** If the `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR` environment variable is set, check `$CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR/decks/` for company-specific overrides:

- `brand.md` — read in full; apply voice, tone, visual identity, and slide patterns to every slide. This is the load-bearing file when present.
- `glossary.md` — read in full; use the company's terminology for stakeholders, acronyms, products, and metric definitions exactly as written.
- Any brand/design guideline PDF in the root of `decks/` (e.g. `*-brand-design-guidelines.pdf`) — note its existence; skim only when `brand.md` doesn't answer a specific visual question.
- `templates/<audience>.md` — if a markdown template matches the audience picked in step 4 (e.g. `exec-review.md` for exec/board), use it instead of the Default Slide Structure below.
- `templates/*.pptx` and `templates/*.pdf` — if generating a `.pptx`, list these and tell the user which template will serve as the visual baseline (cover slide, masters, color palette, fonts) before generation. The `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill may not start from a template directly — if not, generate the deck and then advise the user to apply the template's cover/masters manually.
- `examples/` — list filenames; if any look topically relevant, skim titles and the first 2–3 slides for tone/style alignment. Do not read full contents.

If `CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR` is unset or `$CLAUDE_CONTEXT_DIR/decks/` doesn't exist, proceed with the Default Slide Structure as today.

## Workflow

1. **Gather context.** Ask the user, **one question at a time** (wait for each answer):
   - Topic or initiative name
   - Audience (exec review, board, team standup, stakeholder update)
   - Key message or ask (what do you want the audience to do after this deck?)

2. **Pick the output format.** Ask the user which format to generate:
   - **`.pptx` file** — a real PowerPoint file via the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill (default, no Google setup required)
   - **Google Slides** — a new Slides deck created in the user's Google Drive

3. **If Google Slides, confirm the environment.** Ask which Claude surface they're running in:
   - **Claude Chat** (uses the Google Drive Connector)
   - **Claude Cowork** (uses the Google Drive Connector)
   - **Claude Code** (uses a Google Drive MCP server)

   Tell them to pick whichever surface they already have Google Drive connected in. If they say "not sure" or "not set up," either verify connectivity first (in Claude Code: check for a Google Drive / Slides MCP tool in the available tool list; in Chat/Cowork: ask the user to confirm the connector is enabled under Settings → Connectors) or read `docs/google-workspace-setup.md` and walk them through setup step-by-step before proceeding.

4. **Adapt depth to audience:**
   - **Exec/Board:** High-level, metric-driven, 8–12 slides max
   - **Team/Standup:** More technical detail, 5–8 slides
   - **Stakeholder update:** Progress-focused, 6–10 slides

5. **Generate the deck.**

   - **`.pptx` path:** Use the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill to create a real .pptx file. Populate each slide using the default structure below. Slide count is determined by audience (step 4). Skip slides not relevant to the audience; do not leave empty slides in the deck.

   - **Google Slides path:** Create a new Google Slides deck in the user's Drive, titled `{Initiative Name} — {Audience Type}`. Each slide uses the same Default Slide Structure below. Same audience-based slide count and same "no empty slides" rule apply.

6. **Review.** Present the slide outline to the user and ask if any slides need adjustment before finalizing.

## Default Slide Structure

### Slide 1: Title
- Initiative name
- Subtitle: one-line description
- Author and date

### Slide 2: Problem
- What's broken today
- 3–4 bullet points, each a clear pain statement
- Include a data point or metric if available

### Slide 3: Vision
- What does the world look like when this ships?
- Paint the picture — aspirational but grounded

### Slide 4: Solution
- What we're building
- 3–4 bullets on the approach
- Optional: simple diagram or flow

### Slide 5: Why Now
- Why this is the right time
- Market context, competitive pressure, user demand, technical readiness

### Slide 6: Prototype / Demo
- Screenshots, mockups, or descriptions of the current prototype
- If code exists in the repo, reference it

### Slide 7: Metrics & Success Criteria
- Primary metric and target
- Guardrail metrics
- How we'll measure success

### Slide 8: Risks & Mitigations
- Top 3 risks with mitigation strategies
- Table format: Risk | Impact | Mitigation

### Slide 9: Timeline & Milestones
- Phase breakdown with target dates
- Key dependencies

### Slide 10: The Ask
- What you need from the audience
- Clear, actionable: "We need approval to proceed" / "We need 2 engineers for 4 weeks" / "We need alignment on approach X vs Y"

## Formatting Rules

Apply these across every slide when populating content. The goal is a deck leaders can read at a glance.

- **Slide titles:** noun phrases, max ~6 words. No full sentences.
- **One takeaway per slide.** If you can't summarize the slide in one sentence, split or simplify.
- **Bullets over paragraphs.** No more than 5–6 bullets per slide.
- **Numbers over adjectives** — "15–25% lift" beats "significant lift."
- **Tables for structured data** (risks, timelines, channels). Not for prose.
- **Each slide self-contained** — a reader jumping to one slide should understand its context.

## Rules

- The deck should tell a story: Problem → Vision → Solution → Evidence → Ask.
- Adapt the tone to the audience. Exec decks are concise and metric-heavy. Team decks can be more technical.
- Include data wherever possible. Numbers beat narratives.
- When generating `.pptx`, use the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill for actual .pptx generation — do not just output markdown. When generating Google Slides, use the connected Google Drive surface's tooling to create a real Slides deck — do not just output markdown.
